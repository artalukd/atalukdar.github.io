<h1> About Me </h1>


        <p>I'm a Junior Year student (2015 - 2019) at Birla Institute Technology and Science, Pilani pursuing Engineering in Computer Science. </p>


        <p>I am fascinated by the tremendous growth in AI, especially deep learning. I firmly believe that most pressing issues that the humanity is facing can be solved through Technology.
           Applications of AI in Natural Language Processing is what interests me the most.
        </p>

         <p>I am working with <a href="https://amberwarehouse.github.io/"><b>Amber Warehouse</b></a> a project that is working to reduce food drain wastage in Indian warehouses through IOT based monitoring and data analytics.
         Amber has won several accolades including the India Israel Innovation Challenge.
