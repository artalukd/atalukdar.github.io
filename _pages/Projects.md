##Digital Alarm System using 8086 Micro-Processor
<small>April 2017</small>

<p>Designed a hardware system on Proteus to simulate the working of a digital alarm clock with LCD Display using an 8086 Micro-Processor for a course. An assembly script was used to run the model. Find more details of the project <a href="https://github.com/atalukdar/MUPI_digital_clock">here</a>.</p>

##MNIST in Python
<small>Under Dr Yashvardhan Sharma, WISOC Lab,  March 2017</small>

<p>Created a library using Numpy that implemented all basic deep learning functionality in python. Used this library to to perform classification task on the popular MNIST dataset for recognition of handwritten digits.

##Nearest Available Hospital Locator Application 
<small>Apogee 2016 Application
</small>
<p>
Developed an Android Platform based Application that provides the user with the nearest hospitals from his/her location that have the required medical facilities available at that moment. Hospitals will update their database of the different types of beds available and availability of other medical facilities (e.g.: ventilators, operation theatres, etc) real-time. This application would provide the user with the necessary information. It was supported by backend in Django framework.
