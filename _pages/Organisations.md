## BITSACM
<small>Jan 2016 - Present</small><br>
<small>Position held: Secretary (June 2017 - Present)</small>
<p><a href="http://bitsacm.acm.org/">BITSACM</a> has been awarded as the best student chapter in India for the past 4 consecutive years. Find my contributions to <a href="http://bitsacm.acm.org/">BITSACM</a> <a href="/organisations/BITSACM/">here</a>.</p>

<p>My journey with BITSACM has been a remarkable one. It has played an impeccable role in shaping me as a team player and an innovator. Most of my technical work for BITSACM has been regarding Web Development and Machine Learning, but apart from that the major work went into organising, managing and communicating with team-mates. The values of discipline, leadership and responsibility were nurtured in me through BITSACM.</p>

<p>I have been actively participating in all the event management and development of the chapter since I joined it. I have been active in recruitments, fests and all the meets conducted by and for the chapter. I also currently head the MAchine Learning SIG of the chapter.</p>
